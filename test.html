                 <article>
                        <p> I am a person who appreciate visual art. I am blown away when I visit websites that have a
                            great UI that navigates seemlessly. I have begun my journey to become a software engineer to
                            build intuitive websites that could hopefully inspire someone else to become a web
                            developer.</p>
